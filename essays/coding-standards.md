## Experience with ESLint and VSCode
My first impression of ESLint in VSCode was, wow, that’s a lot of red. I believe I had 34 errors, and they were all syntax-related, including things like blank spacing—which I tend to do a lot—extra semicolons, missing parentheses, inconsistent indentation, and even unused variables. At first, it looked overwhelming.
It wasn’t too much of a bother, though, since VSCode lets me automatically fix all the syntax errors. Still, it served as a reminder of how mindful I should be when writing code. Just because I have no trouble reading or understanding what I’ve coded doesn’t mean others will. I do think it’s useful to have these errors because they teach me to write code properly and maintain clean, readable structure.

## Experience with ESLint and VSCode
To me, coding standards are like following a recipe when cooking. If you skip steps or mix ingredients in the wrong order, the dish might still cook, but it won’t turn out as intended—and it will be confusing for anyone else trying to replicate it. Similarly, neat and properly structured code ensures that your program works correctly and that other people can understand it. Following standards forces you to pay attention to syntax, conventions, and best practices. It trains you to write code thoughtfully, helping you internalize the language and its rules.

So yes, I do think coding standards can help you learn how to code, not just make your code look nicer. They improve readability, reduce errors, and teach discipline that benefits both solo projects and teamwork.
