## Experience with ESLint and VSCode
My first impression of ESLint in VSCode was, wow, that’s a lot of red. I believe I had 34 errors, and they were all syntax-related, including things like blank spacing—which I tend to do a lot—extra semicolons, missing parentheses, inconsistent indentation, and even unused variables. At first, it looked overwhelming.
It wasn’t too much of a bother, though, since VSCode lets me automatically fix all the syntax errors. Still, it served as a reminder of how mindful I should be when writing code. Just because I have no trouble reading or understanding what I’ve coded doesn’t mean others will. I do think it’s useful to have these errors because they teach me to write code properly and maintain clean, readable structure.
