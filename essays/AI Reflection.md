### Gotta stay mindful
Learning to code can be challenging, especially when faced with new concepts and tight deadlines. Throughout this course, I found AI tools like ChatGPT and VS Code Copilot to be incredibly helpful for understanding lessons, generating code, and troubleshooting problems. At the same time, I realized that it can be hard not to rely on AI, especially when tasks are complex or time is limited. However, relying too heavily on AI can hinder my coding ability if I don’t actively engage with the material. It’s important to stay aware of what I am learning and make sure I truly understand the concepts, rather than blindly accepting AI-generated solutions.

## Experience WODs 
The solution videos for the experience WODs were a big help, so I didn’t really need to rely on AI for them. Watching the videos allowed me to see step-by-step how the problems could be solved, which helped me understand the reasoning behind each approach. After watching a video, I would attempt the WOD again on my own, applying what I had learned and checking my work against the solution. This process reinforced my understanding and gave me more confidence in solving similar problems without needing to turn to AI. In this case, the videos served as a clear guide, making AI assistance unnecessary.

## In-class Practice WODs
For the in-person practice WODs, I mostly tried to code without using AI. I relied on the example problems from our lessons to guide me. However, the class moved very fast, and I had to learn many new concepts in a short amount of time and apply them immediately. Because of this, it was difficult not to use AI, and I had to rely on it to make sure I could get everything done.

## In-class WODs 
I did rely on AI during in-class WODs because I did not want to DNF any of them and hurt my grade. At first, I tried copying and pasting the entire instructions into ChatGPT, but that did not help much because the generated code needed a lot of fixing to properly match the instructions. Since the practice WODs were similar to the in-class WODs, I found it more helpful to build off those examples instead.

## Essays
I have it fix my grammar errors and make my writing more clear.

## Final project
The issues I worked on were heavily assisted by AI, specifically the VS Code Copilot. I found it extremely helpful in guiding me toward the correct approach and clarifying what needed to be done. The issues were quite complex and time-consuming, so much of my code was developed with Copilot’s assistance, especially in structuring solutions and troubleshooting problems. While most of my code was generated by AI, I made sure to understand how it works because I didn’t want to be clueless about what it meant or why it worked.

## Learning concepts/ tutorials 
I used AI tools such as ChatGPT to expand on topics I was not very familiar with. It helped break down lessons into smaller, simpler parts, making the material easier to understand and apply.

## Answering a question in class or in Discord
The professor incourage to ask chatgpt to answer the questions in class so i did. But i didnt use AI for any of the discord questions mainly because i didnt answer any of them.

## Asking or answering a smart-question
I didn't ask a lot of questions or answered any of the smart-questions so i didnt use AI for any of them.

## Coding example
I used AI to break down code that I didn’t understand and then asked it to provide additional examples of how that code could be used in different ways.

## Explaining code
I found AI really helpful when it came to explaining code. By asking it to break the code down into simpler terms, it made the material much easier to understand.

## Writing code
As we progressed in class, I began heavily relying on AI to generate my code, especially for the final project. For example, when building my Prisma schema, I wrote a detailed description of what I wanted it to do and had Copilot generate the code for me. However, it still took time to understand what the AI was generating, and I carefully reviewed and adjusted the code as needed to ensure it worked correctly and that I fully understood how it functioned.

## Documenting code
I wrote a basic outline explaining what each part of the code meant, then used Copilot to write instructions on what the code was doing.

## Quality assurance
I relied on Copilot to help fix errors since it was easier than manually searching through large amounts of code. However, there were times when Copilot claimed an issue was fixed but the problem remained, so I had to go in and fix the code myself.
