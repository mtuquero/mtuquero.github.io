##Approach to Time Estimation
I estimated my time through the WODs and my confidence when it came to the issue I was working on. I also usually overestimated my coding effort because I believed it was better to account for potential bugs, integration issues, or refactoring that might be needed. This helped ensure I had enough time to complete tasks without rushing, even when the actual coding effort ended up being lower.

##Value of Pre-Planning Effort
Even though my coding estimates were not as accurate as I initially expected, estimating in advance still provided clear benefits. It helped me plan my work and allocate enough time to complete tasks without rushing. Tracking my coding effort showed me how long writing and debugging code actually took, especially when I got stuck, which often took longer than expected. I also noticed that while AI tools such as Copilot sometimes helped me complete tasks faster, they could also increase my effort when generated code needed to be reviewed, corrected, or integrated. Tracking this effort helped me better understand how AI impacted my workflow and adjust future estimates accordingly.

##Usefulness of Tracking Actual Effort
I have mixed feelings about tracking actual effort. On one hand, it is clearly useful—it gives insight into how long tasks really take and helps refine future estimates and project planning. On the other hand, staying consistent and disciplined with tracking time can be challenging. Despite this, even partial tracking helped me see patterns in my workflow and made me more aware of where time was spent.

##How I Recorded My Effort
Effort tracking was inconsistent during Milestone 1, as our team did not fully account for time tracking at the start of the project. In Milestones 2 and 3, I tracked my effort more consistently using the timer on my iPhone to record both coding and non-coding effort. I sometimes found it difficult to stay consistent, as I would get focused on coding and forget to start or stop the timer. Because of this, the data may not be perfectly accurate, but I believe it is reasonably representative of the actual effort I spent on each task.

##Lessons Learned for Better Estimation
Next time, I would change how I approach each issue, taking into account that my current data is not accurate enough. I would try to gather more reliable information from previous tasks, break down issues into smaller, more manageable parts, and incorporate the extra time needed for debugging or integrating AI-generated code. This could help make my estimates more realistic and tracking more meaningful.
