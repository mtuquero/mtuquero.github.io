Can Coding Standards Help You Learn a Language?

To me, coding standards are like following a recipe when cooking. If you skip steps or mix ingredients in the wrong order, the dish might still cook, but it won’t turn out as intended—and it will be confusing for anyone else trying to replicate it. Similarly, neat and properly structured code ensures that your program works correctly and that other people can understand it. Following standards forces you to pay attention to syntax, conventions, and best practices. It trains you to write code thoughtfully, helping you internalize the language and its rules.
So yes, I do think coding standards can help you learn how to code, not just make your code look nicer. They improve readability, reduce errors, and teach discipline that benefits both solo projects and teamwork.
