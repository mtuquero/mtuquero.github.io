## Experience with ESLint and VSCode
My first impression of ESLint in VSCode was, wow, that’s a lot of red. I believe I had 34 errors, and they were all syntax-related, including things like blank spacing—which I tend to do a lot—extra semicolons, missing parentheses, inconsistent indentation, and even unused variables. At first, it looked overwhelming.
It wasn’t too much of a bother, though, since VSCode lets me automatically fix all the syntax errors. Still, it served as a reminder of how mindful I should be when writing code. Just because I have no trouble reading or understanding what I’ve coded doesn’t mean others will. I do think it’s useful to have these errors because they teach me to write code properly and maintain clean, readable structure.

## 

The WOD (Work of the Day) has become a central part of how I track my progress in learning TypeScript. It can definitely feel overwhelming, especially since we are timed and need to finish within a certain timeframe. I will probably become more accustomed to that pressure. Its a good thing that we have practice WODs, which allow me to build my knowledge and prepare for the real challenge—particularly when I struggled to complete the practice version. Learning through trial and error is inevitable, especially as a beginner in TypeScript, but it is also one of the most effective ways to improve. The WODs help me maintain a steady workflow and ensure that I focus on areas where I need improvement. While I should always study, these exercises force me to stay consistent, preventing procrastination and reinforcing good learning habits.

## lets finish strong

Being honest, it’s going to be challenging. TypeScript, more than many other languages, requires me to understand why I’m doing something, not just what I’m doing. Its structure and type system push me to think critically about the logic behind each decision, which makes the learning process deeper and more meaningful. This kind of understanding goes beyond memorizing syntax—it helps me see patterns, predict outcomes, and write code that is both correct and maintainable. The WODs can be stressful, and putting in the hours consistently is demanding, but the sense of accomplishment I feel when I complete an assignment makes all the effort worthwhile.
