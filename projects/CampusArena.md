## Overview
CampusArena is a web application designed for UH Mānoa students to organize and join recreational leagues and tournaments for both sports and esports. The platform simplifies event management by providing a single place to create tournaments, track match results, manage participants, and monitor standings, instead of relying on spreadsheets or chat groups.  

Students can create accounts, browse ongoing competitions, join events, and view their personal match history on a dashboard. The platform supports different roles—participants, organizers, and administrators—each with specific permissions. Organizers handle event creation and management, while administrators oversee fairness and manage the overall system. CampusArena was developed by a team of ICS students as part of ICS 314, using Issue Driven Project Management to guide the workflow.

## My Contributions
I worked on both **front-end and back-end features** of CampusArena, with a focus on the match page. I helped implement player check-ins, score reporting, and match result updates. I also resolved **issues with the event brackets** so tournaments displayed correctly and ran smoothly.  

In addition to coding, I assisted in **planning and organizing the project**, helping the team manage milestones, define features, and prioritize tasks using IDPM. I also contributed to database integration and made improvements to UI components to make the platform more user-friendly.

## Lessons Learned
Working on CampusArena gave me practical experience with team-based software development. I learned the importance of **tracking issues, coordinating tasks, and communicating clearly** when multiple developers are working on the same project.  

I also discovered how challenging it can be to balance front-end design with back-end functionality and to debug complex features like event brackets. This project reinforced that software engineering is more than just coding—successful applications require organization, testing, and careful coordination among team members.
