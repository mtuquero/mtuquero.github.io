## App Overview
Me and my teammates created a web application called CampusArena in our ICS 314 class. It helps UH Mānoa students join and organize sports and esports leagues and tournaments. The platform makes managing events easy by letting users create tournaments, track match results, manage participants, and view standings—all in one place instead of using spreadsheets or chat groups.

Students can create accounts, browse competitions, join events, and check their match history on a personal dashboard. The app has different roles: participants, organizers, and administrators. Organizers manage events, while administrators oversee the system and ensure fairness.

## My Contributions
I worked on both **front-end and back-end features** of CampusArena, with a focus on the match page. I helped implement player check-ins, score reporting, and match result updates. I also resolved **issues with the event brackets** so tournaments displayed correctly and ran smoothly.  

In addition to coding, I assisted in **planning and organizing the project**, helping the team manage milestones and define features. I also contributed to database integration and made improvements to UI components to make the platform more user-friendly.

## What I Learned
Working on CampusArena gave me practical experience with team-based software development. I learned the importance of **tracking issues, coordinating tasks, and communicating clearly** when multiple developers are working on the same project.  

I also discovered how challenging it can be to balance front-end design with back-end functionality and to debug complex features like event brackets. This project reinforced that software engineering is more than just coding—successful applications require organization, testing, and careful coordination among team members.
