This is more of a personal project that I did. I was really interested in a particular 3DS game, but it was nearly impossible to find in stores and most people were reselling it for around $100. Instead of giving up, I decided to take matters into my own hands and homebrew my 3DS. Homebrewing is basically modifying the system so you can run custom software and apps that aren’t normally allowed on the console.  

Since this was my first time doing something like this, I had to do a lot of research and watch plenty of videos. Most of the tutorials I found were outdated, so I had to figure out what actually worked and piece together the steps carefully. The process involved preparing the SD card, installing the proper software, following precise instructions to flash custom firmware, and testing everything to make sure I didn’t accidentally damage my 3DS. It actually sounded more complicated than it turned out to be, and I was able to get most of the old 3DS games for free, so I don’t really have to spend money on games anymore. It was all done solo, so I was responsible for each part of the process and troubleshooting on my own.  

Through this project, I learned a lot about hardware modification, problem-solving, and how software interacts with a system on a low level. I also gained experience in researching technical topics, verifying information from multiple sources, and carefully following detailed instructions. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding project that taught me how to manage a technical endeavor from start to finish.
