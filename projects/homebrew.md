This is more of a personal project that I did. I was really interested in a particular 3DS game, but it was nearly impossible to find in stores and most people were reselling it for around $100. Instead of giving up, I decided to take matters into my own hands and homebrew my 3DS. Homebrewing is basically modifying the system so you can run custom software and apps that aren’t normally allowed on the console.  

Since this was my first time doing something like this, I had to do a lot of research and watch plenty of videos. But most of the tutorials I found were outdated. The process involved preparing the SD card, installing the proper software, following instructions to flash custom firmware, and testing everything to make sure I didn’t accidentally damage my 3DS. It actually sounded more complicated than it turned out to be, and I was able to get most of the old 3DS games for free, so I don’t really have to spend money on games anymore. It was all done solo, so I was responsible for each part of the process and troubleshooting on my own.  

I learned a lot about troubleshooting technical issues and working with hardware. I also got better at researching and figuring out which steps actually work when instructions are outdated. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding experience that taught me how to handle a technical project on my own from start to finish.
