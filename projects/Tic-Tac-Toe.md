Tic Tac Toe is a Java game I created completely on my own to practice building a graphical user interface (GUI) and writing game logic.  

The game lets you play as **X** against the computer (which plays as **O**). It keeps track of turns, checks for a winner or a draw, and pops up messages to let you know how the game ended.  

I built this project using **Java Swing** for the interface, and added logic to handle things like:
- Switching between the player and the computer  
- Making sure a square canâ€™t be used twice  
- Checking for wins across rows, columns, and diagonals  
- Detecting a draw when the board is full  

Since I worked on this project by myself, it gave me hands-on experience with **Java GUI programming**, **event handling**, and managing all parts of the project from start to finish.
